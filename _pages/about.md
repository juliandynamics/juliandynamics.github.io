Cloud Security has been my passion for over a decade. I've had the luxury of working in the industry in a number of capacities and roles: everything from managing a team of security engineers in a large enterprise, to running modernization initiatives in federal government, to actively defending against threats for a small startup. There are challenges on every platform and the threat landscape is becoming <strong>more complex</strong> day by day.  

I believe strongly in action over words. When I work with clients, I seek to iteratively address their problems with a focus on producing code or systems solutions that are sustainable in the long term. There's no one solution to security and we will never "finish" securing our systems. Organizations need to cultivate a culture of engineering security in order to adequately address the current and future challenges. 

Contact me and let's <strong>build something</strong> together.
